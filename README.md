##### 2. Medium:
Minimax algorithm with 30% randomness. AI can choose a random spot with 30% probability.

##### 3. Impossible:
Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimization of minimax algorithm as it reduces the time complexity by pruning nodes in the minimax tree (abstract).
Score to a terminal state is assigned with +- depth of that state which accounts for the closness of this terminal state to the current state. Closser terminal states means faster winning move.
